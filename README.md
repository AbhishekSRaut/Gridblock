## 📝 About the Game
Gridblock is a board game played on an **8x8 grid** using **16 pieces**. The goal is to strategically place your pieces to block your opponent's moves while ensuring your own moves remain open.

### 🧠 Game Logic
- Once you place a piece on any grid square, the following squares get blocked:
  - **Adjacent squares**
  - **Diagonal squares**
  - **Opposite squares** (by one position)
- This means your opponent cannot place their piece on these blocked squares.
- The blocking rule applies to your moves as well.

#### 💡 Example
If you place your piece on **B4**, the following squares get blocked:
- **B3, B5**
- **C5, C3**
- **A4, C4**

## 🔴⚫ Game Pieces
- The pieces come in two colors: **Red** and **Black**.
- If you play as **Red**, the bot will automatically be **Black**.
- The **first move** is determined by a toss.

## 🏆 How to Win or Lose
